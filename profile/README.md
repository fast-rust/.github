# Fast Rust

A book from Packt dedicated to low level rust and geting the most performance
out of your computer with Rust.

This is not a book about fixing already broken code, but about how to understand
the compiler and the low level machine that your code runs on so that you
can write new projects that go faster.

We'll talk about the balance between fast code and good developer experience, how
to structure your project to compile faster, how to use SIMD, atomics and zero copy.
